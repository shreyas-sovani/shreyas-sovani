I'm Shreyas, a CSE (AI/ML) undergrad focused on building practical ML projects with a strong foundation in Python, data analysis, and visualization. I enjoy turning theory into hands-on code, whether through deep learning, computer vision, or debugging late into the night. My tech stack includes tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, and I'm currently diving deeper into model building and clean, scalable code. Outside of coding, I play guitar, embrace structured learning, and believe progress—like a loss function—is iterative. My goals include becoming a full-stack ML engineer, contributing to open-source, and building projects that outlast college. Let’s connect on LinkedIn or reach out at sovanishreyas@gmail.com.
