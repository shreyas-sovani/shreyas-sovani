I'm Shreyas, a CSE undergrad building at the intersection of Web3 and Machine Learning. My focus is on developing intelligent dApps by applying Python and ML algorithms directly to the blockchain.

I thrive on turning complex concepts into clean, scalable code, whether for analyzing on-chain data or securing a smart contract. Believing that progress is iterative, my goal is to contribute to foundational Web3 protocols and build for the decentralized future.
